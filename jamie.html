      <p>
        Jamie Gong is the co-founder and CEO of <em>Care Hero</em>, a technology-driven platform transforming the senior care industry.
        Inspired by her grandmother‚Äôs Alzheimer‚Äôs journey, Gong recognized flaws in traditional caregiving systems
        and built AI-powered tools to better match families with caregivers, streamline insurance processes, and empower workers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Care Hero has been recognized by MIT‚Äôs AI Venture Studio and the Harvard Innovation Lab,
        highlighting Gong‚Äôs role in merging innovation with social good. By rethinking how care is valued,
        Gong challenges societal implicit bias that often treats caregiving‚Äîwork disproportionately done by women and immigrants‚Äî
        as ‚Äúlow-skilled‚Äù or invisible labor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her work reflects <strong>intersectionality</strong>: caregiving is shaped by gender, race, and class.
        Many caregivers are women of color or immigrants who face systemic inequities in pay and recognition.
        By leveraging technology to give caregivers more agency and families more transparency,
        Gong not only disrupts an industry but also addresses overlapping injustices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gong‚Äôs leadership illustrates how technology can support inclusion by elevating undervalued labor.
        Just as implicit bias often devalues care work, Gong reframes it as a field requiring skill, dignity, and innovation.
        Her story shows how tech can bridge gaps and promote justice, echoing the course themes of equity and representation in design.
