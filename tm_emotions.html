      <h1>Emotion Classifier – Teachable Machine</h1>
      <p>
        For Project 3, we built a small <strong>image-based emotion classifier</strong> using Google’s
        Teachable Machine. Our goal is not just to “make AI work,” but to use this tiny model to think
        about <strong>power, bias, and digital surveillance</strong> in the spirit of Joy Buolamwini’s
        <em>Unmasking AI</em> and our Tech Heroes.
      </p>

      <!-- HOW TO USE -->
      <section>
        <h2>Try the Demo</h2>
        <p>
          When the model is connected, this page will use your webcam to try to recognize four basic
          facial expressions:
          <strong>happy, sad, angry, and surprised</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section will be activated once our trained model is exported from Teachable Machine.
        </p>

          Note: This demo runs entirely in your browser using TensorFlow.js. No video is saved or sent

      <!-- WHY EMOTIONS + TECH HEROES -->
      <section>
        <h2>Why Emotions? Connecting to Our Tech Heroes</h2>
        <p>
          Emotion recognition sounds playful, but similar ideas are already used in workplaces and
          classrooms to judge whether people are “engaged” or “motivated.” We wanted to imagine how our
          small project might look through the eyes of our Tech Heroes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ifeoma Ozoma</strong> exposed racism and retaliation inside large tech companies.
            If our classifier were used to score students or workers, who would be able to question the
            labels? How would whistleblowers push back when a “neutral” face is misread as
            “unmotivated” or “angry”?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dorothy Vaughan</strong> was an early NASA programmer who navigated both racism and
            sexism while working with code and computation. Thinking with Dorothy reminds us that
            <strong>algorithms are human decisions written into math</strong>. Our choices about labels,
            data collection, and thresholds all embed our own assumptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Jamie Gong</strong> builds technology around care work for families and older
            adults. Her example pushes us to ask: could an emotion-recognition tool support
            <em>self-reflection and care</em> instead of surveillance? What would it mean to design this
            system for the person in front of the camera, not the institution watching them?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- DATA & TRAINING -->
      <section>
        <h2>How We Train the Model</h2>
        <p>
          We are currently preparing our dataset in Teachable Machine. Our plan is to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <strong>four classes</strong>: happy, sad, angry, and surprised.</li>
          <li>Collect examples from <strong>all three group members</strong>, not just one face.</li>
          <li>
            Vary lighting, camera distance, and background so the model does not only work in a single
            “perfect” setup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep expressions realistic (the kind of faces students actually make in class), not just
            exaggerated cartoon faces.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After collecting the examples, Teachable Machine will convert the short video clips into
          image frames and train a model. We will then <strong>export the model to TensorFlow.js</strong>
          and connect it to this page through a small JavaScript file.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- UNMASKING AI LINKS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Lessons from <em>Unmasking AI</em></h2>
        <p>
          Joy Buolamwini shows how commercial facial analysis systems often perform worst on
          darker-skinned women, turning them into “error” cases while lighter-skinned men are treated
          as the default face. While building this project, we are keeping several of her lessons in
          mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data is never neutral.</strong> If we only use one person’s face, the model will be
            tuned to that one identity and may misread others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Labels are decisions, not facts.</strong> Our definitions of “happy,” “sad,” or
            “angry” come from our own culture and experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accuracy is not the same as fairness.</strong> Even if the model looks confident on
            our test data, it may still be unfair or harmful in other contexts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By treating this assignment as a small, low-stakes experiment, we can better understand why
          large-scale facial recognition systems need strong accountability, diverse data, and clear
          limits on how they are used.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- LIMITATIONS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Limitations & Open Questions</h2>
        <p>
          This demo is meant for learning, not for making real decisions about people. We expect the
          model to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work best on the three creators and less reliably on people with different features.</li>
          <li>Struggle in low light, extreme brightness, or unusual camera angles.</li>
          <li>
            Confuse subtle expressions that fall between two labels (for example, a tired smile vs.
            neutral).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These limitations echo Joy Buolamwini’s warning that AI systems often fail hardest on the
          people who are already marginalized. Our project is a reminder that <strong>building AI
          always means making choices about whose faces, emotions, and stories are centered</strong>.
