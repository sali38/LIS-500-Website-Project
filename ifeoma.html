      <h1>Tech Hero: Ifeoma Ozoma</h1>
      <blockquote class="quote">“Preparedness is power.” <cite>— Ifeoma Ozoma</cite></blockquote>

      <p>
        Ifeoma Ozoma is a policy expert, equity advocate, and one of the most recognized whistleblowers
        in Silicon Valley. She has worked at major companies including Google, Facebook, and Pinterest,
        where she publicly spoke out against racism, gender discrimination, and pay inequity.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020, Ozoma helped expose discriminatory practices at Pinterest — an act that brought national
        attention to inequities in tech workplaces. Beyond her personal experience, she co-authored
        the landmark <strong>Silenced No More Act (2021)</strong> in California, preventing companies from
        using NDAs to silence workers who report harassment or discrimination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ozoma later launched the 
        <a href="https://techworkerhandbook.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Tech Worker Handbook
        </a>, a free resource offering guidance for workers navigating contracts, whistleblowing, legal
        retaliation, and media interactions. It has since become a widely used toolkit for tech employees
        seeking transparency and safety.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her story exemplifies <strong>intersectionality</strong>. As a Black woman in tech, Ozoma faced
        overlapping systems of bias — showing how inequity is not a single-axis issue. Her activism
        challenges tech culture to address power structures, not just diversity statistics.

        Today, Ozoma runs the consulting firm <strong>Earthseed</strong>, advising organizations on equity,
        worker rights, and accountability in digital environments. Her work continues to shape policies
        that protect employees and challenge corporate power.
