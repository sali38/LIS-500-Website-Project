      <p>
        Ifeoma Ozoma is a policy expert and activist, and one of the most prominent whistleblowers in the U.S. tech industry.
        A Yale graduate and daughter of Nigerian immigrants, she worked at Google, Facebook, and Pinterest, where she experienced racism,
        gender discrimination, and unequal pay. In 2020, she and her colleague publicly accused Pinterest of discrimination,
        breaking the silence many tech workers had endured.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond sharing her story, Ozoma became a key advocate for structural change.
        She helped drive the passage of California’s <em>Silenced No More Act</em> in 2021,
        which prohibits companies from using nondisclosure agreements to silence employees who report workplace discrimination.
        Her advocacy has inspired similar efforts in other states.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ozoma also launched the <a href="https://techworkerhandbook.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tech Worker Handbook</a>,
        a practical resource that educates employees about their rights, how to navigate NDAs, and how to protect themselves if they choose to speak out.
        The handbook has already reached tens of thousands of readers, empowering workers to challenge unfair systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her journey highlights intersectionality: how race, gender, and class intersect in shaping workplace experiences.
        As a Black woman in Silicon Valley, Ozoma showed how systemic inequality is reinforced not only by individual biases
        but also by institutional practices such as wage gaps and restrictive contracts. By transforming her challenges into activism,
        she has influenced corporate policies, cultural expectations, and laws.

        Today, Ozoma continues her advocacy through her consulting firm <strong>Earthseed</strong>, advising organizations on equity and inclusion
        while holding tech giants like Apple accountable. Her guiding principle is simple but powerful: <strong>“Preparation is Power.”</strong>
