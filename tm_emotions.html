      <h1>Emotion Classifier – Teachable Machine</h1>
      <p>
        For Project 3, we built a small <strong>image-based emotion classifier</strong> using Google’s
        Teachable Machine. Our goal is not just to “make AI work,” but to use this tiny model to think
        about <strong>power, bias, and digital surveillance</strong> in the spirit of Joy Buolamwini’s
        <em>Unmasking AI</em> and our Tech Heroes.

      <!-- WHY EMOTIONS + TECH HEROES -->
      <section>
        <h2>Why Emotions? Connecting to Our Tech Heroes</h2>
        <p>
          Emotion recognition sounds playful, but similar ideas are already used in workplaces and
          classrooms to judge whether people are “engaged” or “motivated.” We wanted to imagine how our
          small project might look through the eyes of our Tech Heroes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ifeoma Ozoma</strong> exposed racism and retaliation inside large tech companies.
            If our classifier were used to score students or workers, who would be able to question the
            labels? How would whistleblowers push back when a “neutral” face is misread as
            “unmotivated” or “angry”?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dorothy Vaughan</strong> was an early NASA programmer who navigated both racism and
            sexism while working with code and computation. Thinking with Dorothy reminds us that
            <strong>algorithms are human decisions written into math</strong>. Our choices about labels,
            data collection, and thresholds all embed our own assumptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Jamie Gong</strong> builds technology around care work for families and older
            adults. Her example pushes us to ask: could an emotion-recognition tool support
            <em>self-reflection and care</em> instead of surveillance? What would it mean to design this
            system for the person in front of the camera, not the institution watching them?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- DATA & TRAINING -->
      <section>
        <h2>How We Trained the Model</h2>
        <p>
          We trained our Teachable Machine model with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Three classes</strong>: happy, sad, and angry.</li>
          <li>Examples from <strong>all three group members</strong>, not just one face.</li>
          <li>
            Different lighting, camera distance, and background so the model does not only work in a
            single “perfect” setup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Realistic expressions (the kind of faces students actually make in class), not just
            exaggerated cartoon faces.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Teachable Machine converted our short video clips into image frames and trained the model.
          We then <strong>exported the model to TensorFlow.js</strong> and connected it to this page
          through the JavaScript below.

      <!-- UNMASKING AI LINKS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Lessons from <em>Unmasking AI</em></h2>
        <p>
          Joy Buolamwini shows how commercial facial analysis systems often perform worst on
          darker-skinned women, turning them into “error” cases while lighter-skinned men are treated
          as the default face. While building this project, we are keeping several of her lessons in
          mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data is never neutral.</strong> If we only use one person’s face, the model will be
            tuned to that one identity and may misread others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Labels are decisions, not facts.</strong> Our definitions of “happy,” “sad,” or
            “angry” come from our own culture and experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accuracy is not the same as fairness.</strong> Even if the model looks confident on
            our test data, it may still be unfair or harmful in other contexts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By treating this assignment as a small, low-stakes experiment, we can better understand why
          large-scale facial recognition systems need strong accountability, diverse data, and clear
          limits on how they are used.
        </p>

            <p>
              For our team, we were able to take away several lessons from computer scientist and AI
              researcher Dr. Joy Buolamwini’s book <em>Unmasking AI</em>. Such lessons have allowed us
              to better create our final project, so that we can avoid past mistakes and create an
              outcome that is equitable for all, not just for some.
            </p>
            <p>
              This being said, each of us will share a few lessons that have resonated with us from
              Dr. Buolamwini’s book.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Samira, a lesson that resonated the most is that technology, especially in regard to
              artificial intelligence facial recognition, is that these systems are never neutral. It is
              no coincidence that racism and biases just appear, for example, in the mis-gendering of
              prominent Civil Rights activist Sojourner Truth through the usage of said facial
              recognition. This goes much deeper than just a simple misidentification of a historical
              figure. What Truth and so many others have accomplished and have endured just to be
              misgendered and/or misidentified by technology that is programmed by humans and thus
              should know how to properly identify notable figures evidently shows such non-neutral
              technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yunji included the lesson of the fight to maintain privacy to one’s biometric information,
              specifically in regard to one’s home government and governments around the world. Nation’s
              governments have the job to protect its citizens in more ways than one, especially when
              one’s information is threatened to be stolen. Along with this, not only should governments
              around the world be protecting its citizens digitally from harm, but said governments
              should also be holding those looking to cause harm responsible. To ensure this occurs, we
              must continue to demand local, state, and the federal government to protect our rights so
              everyone’s information is safe and secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              And for Ellah, similarly to Samira’s, the idea that AI facial recognition was only able to
              correctly identify those with light skin really stood out to her. Not only was this action
              clearly troubling, but something that is even more frightening is that companies want to
              continue to move forward with facial recognition technologies like in Dr. Buolamwini’s
              “Dream Mirror Project,” despite clear evidence of racial biases present, specifically in
              regard to those with dark skin. This being said, it is not only crucial for those who are
              joining the tech industry to work to dismantle racism and racial biases within the
              industry, but also to stand up to the already existing companies that enforce products
              with embedded racism and racial biases.
            </p>
            <p>
              After reading <em>Unmasking AI</em>, we all came to the same conclusion: we must keep the
              lessons taught by Dr. Buolamwini within our minds not only in the present, but far into
              our futures as well. Since technology, artificial intelligence, and other systems will
              only continue to grow for the rest of our lives, we as programmers, professionals, and
              consumers of technology must work to better everyone, not just for a select few. Just as
              Dr. Buolamwini notes, artificial intelligence should not cease to exist, but rather
              stereotypes and harmful assumptions that are programmed into it should no longer exist. We
              must continue to strive for a future where the systems we have in place now are more
              equitable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, when creating our teachable machine, we chose to teach our machine three common
              human emotions, these being happiness, sadness, and anger. These emotions were chosen
              because, though able to be shown differently person-to-person, overall tend to be
              universal in a basic form. For many, happiness can be equated with someone smiling,
              sadness with crying, and anger with furrowed brows and maybe one using an elevated voice.
              However, as we have learned from Dr. Buolamwini, simply using these emotions based on one
              person's data can be unhelpful, it would narrow down what our model could recognize. We
              kept in mind that this is how discriminatory systems are able to be created, and tried to
              widen our dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tying this understanding of emotions with our lessons from Dr. Buolamwini, we from the
              beginning made it our goal for our machine to recognize the aforementioned emotions from
              multiple groups of people, rather than just one person or one group of people. Programming
              biases and discrimination into technology is something that is done by humans, and
              therefore is something that needs to be undone by humans as well, which is why this lesson
              stood out so much to us when creating our machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our teachable machine is just one drop in the large ocean of technology that has been
              embedded with racism, biases, and many other forms of discrimination. Despite this,
              however, through projects like ours, those within our class, and others across universities
              and companies around the world, our collective fight and learned knowledge of how
              discrimination is designed within our technology only makes us stronger. We are more aware
              of how to program out these harmful designs, and how crucial it is for people from all
              walks of life to be a part of creation and design of technology, especially in regard to
              artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also important to note that this is a continued process, not a one time fix.
              Programmers may initially create these biased technologies unintentionally, however the
              harm they cause is still significant and disproportionately affects marginalized
              communities. <em>Unmasking AI</em> has taught us that it is crucial to ask how a system or
              technology thought to be neutral affects all communities. That is why for our project we
              hope to test and train our model on multiple different faces, and discuss how accurate it
              is on picking up what emotion is being portrayed. It is important to compare what emotions
              the machine struggled to pick up, if it was not picking up emotions accurately on a
              specific person. We also were making note of other smaller factors that could introduce
              bias into our project as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this being said, we hope that you enjoy browsing our website and interacting with
              our teachable machine, and that you are doing everything possible to help artificial
              intelligence, and technology as a whole, now and into the future become programmed without
              discrimination and is representative of the world as a whole, not just for a select few.

      <!-- LIMITATIONS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Limitations &amp; Open Questions</h2>
        <p>
          This demo is meant for learning, not for making real decisions about people. We expect the
          model to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work best on the three creators and less reliably on people with different features.</li>
          <li>Struggle in low light, extreme brightness, or unusual camera angles.</li>
          <li>
            Confuse subtle expressions that fall between two labels (for example, a tired smile vs.
            neutral).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These limitations echo Joy Buolamwini’s warning that AI systems often fail hardest on the
          people who are already marginalized. Our project is a reminder that <strong>building AI
          always means making choices about whose faces, emotions, and stories are centered</strong>.
