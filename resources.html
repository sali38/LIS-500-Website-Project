  <h3>Implicit Bias</h3>
  <p>Bias refers to the preconceived notions or stereotypes we may hold about people or things. Implicit bias, more specifically, refers to the unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that influence our understanding, actions, and decisions without our awareness. An implicit bias test is designed to reveal the biases someone may unconsciously hold through a series of questions and word associations. There are several types of implicit bias tests, each focusing on different kinds of bias such as age, gender, weight, and more. One well-known example is the Harvard Implicit Association Test (IAT), which includes a variety of these options.   </p>

<h3>Defining Intersectionality</h3>
<p>Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how different aspects of a person's identity such as race, gender, class, sexuality, ability, and more intersect to shape their experiences of privilege and oppression. According to Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge, intersectionality is "a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences." It emphasizes that systems of power such as racism, sexism, classism, and homophobia do not act independently, but are interrelated and compound each other.Intersectionality is especially important in tech, where people from marginalized backgrounds often face multiple overlapping barriers to access, opportunity, and recognition.</p>

<h3>How Implicit Bias and Intersectionality Intersect</h3>
<p> Implicit bias and intersectionality are deeply connected. Intersectionality helps us understand how these identities overlap and how systems of oppression like racism, sexism, or ableism interact to create unique experiences of discrimination or privilege. When we look at implicit bias through an intersectional lens, we see that people who belong to multiple marginalized groups are often impacted more severely. For example, a Black woman in tech may face both racial and gender based biases, not as separate issues, but as a compounded form of discrimination. Recognizing this overlap is essential for creating truly inclusive and equitable environments, especially in fields like technology where diversity is still lacking.</p>
