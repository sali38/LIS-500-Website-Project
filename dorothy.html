      <h1>Tech Hero: Dorothy Vaughan</h1>

      <img class="hero-img" src="dorothy-vaughan.jpg" alt="Portrait of Dorothy Vaughan, NASA mathematician">

      <p>
        Dorothy Vaughan was a trailblazing mathematician and one of NASA’s first Black supervisors.
        Beginning her career in the segregated West Area Computing Unit in the 1940s, she excelled
        despite a workplace shaped by racial segregation and gender inequality. Her leadership paved 
        the way for future generations of women in STEM.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vaughan became an expert programmer in <strong>FORTRAN</strong> during NASA's transition from
        human computers to digital computing. Her mathematical and programming contributions supported 
        space missions including early satellite launches such as the Scout Vehicle program.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her story embodies <strong>intersectionality</strong>: as a Black woman, Vaughan faced multiple
        overlapping barriers related to race and gender. Yet she not only excelled, but actively mentored
        colleagues like Katherine Johnson and Mary Jackson — proving talent thrives when opportunity exists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vaughan’s legacy teaches us that exclusion was never about capability — it was about gatekeeping.
        Her work challenges implicit biases that historically excluded women, especially Black women,
        from technical fields. By breaking these barriers, she reshaped representation in STEM and
        expanded what leadership in tech looks like.
