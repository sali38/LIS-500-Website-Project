          <p><b>Samira Ali</b></p>
          <p><small>
            <b>Pronouns:</b> she/her <br>
            <b>Hometown:</b> Apple Valley, Minnesota <br>
            <b>Major(s):</b> Information Science and Data Science <br>
            <b>Year:</b> Junior <br>
            <b>Tech Hero and/or Tech Thing:</b> Jamie Gong, because she is the founder and CEO of Care Hero, an app that matches families with caregivers for their older family members. The app prioritizes different companionship options and offers culturally sensitive care, and I really appreciate its focus on ease and efficiency for families.

          <p><b>Yunji Lee</b></p>
          <p><small>
            <b>Pronouns:</b> she/her <br>
            <b>Hometown:</b> Seoul, South Korea <br>
            <b>Major(s):</b> Information Science and Data Science <br>
            <b>Year:</b> Senior <br>
            <b>Tech Hero and/or Tech Thing:</b> Ifeoma Ozoma, because she exposed racism and gender discrimination in big tech companies and fought for legal protections through the Silenced No More Act. Her advocacy turned personal struggles into structural change, which I find deeply admirable.

            <b>Tech Hero and/or Tech Thing:</b> I admire Dorothy Vaughan, because she was such a talented figure in the world of mathematics, and accomplished historic feats all while facing both racism and sexism. Her career in NASA and her advocacy for women is incredibly inspiring to look back on.
