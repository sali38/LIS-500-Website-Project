        <h2>Implicit Bias (IBT)</h2>
        <p>
          Bias refers to preconceived notions or stereotypes. <em>Implicit</em> bias means the
          unconscious attitudes that can shape our actions without our awareness. The Harvard
          Implicit Association Test (IAT) offers several modules (race, gender, age, weight, etc.).
          The value isn‚Äôt a single ‚Äúscore,‚Äù but what you notice and reflect on afterwards.

        <h2>Defining Intersectionality</h2>
        <p>
          Intersectionality is a framework for analyzing how aspects of identity (race, gender, class,
          sexuality, ability, etc.) intersect to shape experiences of advantage and harm. Following
          Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge, it‚Äôs ‚Äúa way of understanding and analyzing the
          complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences,‚Äù emphasizing that systems of
          power (racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, ableism) are interrelated and compound one
          another‚Äîrather than acting separately.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          In tech contexts, overlapping barriers (cost, language, bandwidth, gatekeeping) can combine to
          exclude people‚Äîdesign with those intersections in mind.
        </div>

      <section>
        <h2>How They Intersect</h2>
        <p>
          Looking at implicit bias through an intersectional lens helps explain why those in multiple
          marginalized groups can be affected more severely. For example, a Black woman in tech may face
          racialized and gendered bias as a compounded experience‚Äînot two separate issues. Recognizing
          these overlaps is key to building inclusive environments and fair assessments.
