        <h2>Implicit Bias (IAT)</h2>
        <p>
          Bias refers to preconceived notions or stereotypes. <em>Implicit</em> bias means the
          unconscious attitudes that can shape our actions without our active awareness. The Harvard
          Implicit Association Test (IAT) offers several different versions of these tests including race, gender, age, weight, etc.
          The value isn‚Äôt a single ‚Äúscore,‚Äù but what you notice and reflect on afterwards.

          <!-- Intersectionality bias section-->
        <h2>Defining Intersectionality</h2>
        <p>
          Intersectionality is a framework for analyzing how aspects of identity (gender, class,
          race, etc.) intersect to shape experiences of both advantages and harm. According to
          Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge, it‚Äôs ‚Äúa way of understanding and analyzing the
          complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences,‚Äù emphasizing that systems of
          power are connected and compound one another, rather than just acting separately.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          In tech contexts, overlapping barriers (cost, language, bandwidth, gatekeeping) can combine to
          exclude people, design with those intersections in mind.

      <section>
            <!-- Conclusion section-->
        <h2>How They Intersect</h2>
        <p>
          Looking at implicit bias through an intersectional lens helps explain why those in multiple
          marginalized groups can be affected more severely. For example, a Black woman in tech may face
          racialized and gendered bias as a compounded experience, not two separate issues. Her experiences 
          may be different from someone else who also identifies as a woman. Not only recognizing these 
          overlaps but also understanding them is key to building inclusive environments.
