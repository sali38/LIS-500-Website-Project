      <p>
        Dorothy Vaughan was a pioneering mathematician at NACA/NASA and the first African American manager at the agency.
        She led the segregated West Area Computing Unit (1949‚Äì1958), advocated for women computers, and later became an
        expert FORTRAN programmer contributing to early electronic computing and the Scout Launch Vehicle program. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

      <h2>Why she matters (intersectionality)</h2>
      <p>
        Vaughan‚Äôs leadership under Jim Crow segregation exposed how race and gender shaped access to scientific work.
        By mentoring and promoting women (including across racial lines), she expanded pathways into STEM that had been
        structurally closed. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
