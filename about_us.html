            <b>Year:</b> Junior <br>
            <b>Tech Hero and/or Tech Thing:</b> Jamie Gong, because she is the founder and CEO of Care Hero, an app that matches families with caregivers for their older family members. The app prioritizes different companionship options and offers culturally sensitive care, and I really appreciate its focus on ease and efficiency for families.
