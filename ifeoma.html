      <p>
        Ifeoma Ozoma is a policy expert, equity advocate, and one of the most visible whistleblowers in Silicon Valley.
        She worked at Google, Facebook, and Pinterest, where she experienced racism, gender discrimination, and unequal pay.
        In 2020, she and her colleague spoke out against discrimination at Pinterest, breaking the silence enforced by nondisclosure agreements (NDAs).
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond sharing her personal story, Ozoma has driven systemic change. She co-authored California‚Äôs
        <em>Silenced No More Act</em> (2021), legislation that prevents companies from using NDAs to silence workers who
        report discrimination or harassment. This law has since inspired efforts across other U.S. states.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ozoma also launched the <a href="https://techworkerhandbook.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tech Worker Handbook</a>,
        which provides workers with practical guidance on contracts, rights, and how to navigate retaliation if they speak out.
        This resource has already empowered thousands of employees to better understand the systemic nature of bias in tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her journey reflects <strong>intersectionality</strong>: as a Black woman in tech, Ozoma experienced both racial and gender bias simultaneously.
        These overlapping systems of disadvantage shaped her career in ways that highlight how implicit bias is not only individual
        but reinforced by institutional structures such as pay gaps and restrictive contracts. Her activism reminds us that
        addressing diversity in tech must also address how identities intersect and compound barriers.

      <p>
        Today, Ozoma leads her consulting firm <strong>Earthseed</strong>, advising organizations on equity and accountability.
        She has become a central figure in reshaping how companies respond to discrimination, ensuring that
        intersectional perspectives are included in conversations about workplace justice.
